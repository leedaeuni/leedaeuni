## Research Background
The global healthcare system faces significant challenges from mental health conditions such as depression and suicidal ideation, emphasizing the need for an advanced monitoring system for early intervention.
Social media platforms provide an easily accessible and time-saving communication approach for individuals with mental disorders compared to face-to-face meetings with medical providers. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based mental health exploration using large-scale social media data has attracted significant attention {% cite kim2021machine %}.

## Research Goal
We aims to help to establish a prevention system for early detection and immediate intervention of individuals with high-risk suicidality for clinical support using social media data. This will enable us to reduce mental health-related social costs and promote public health.
