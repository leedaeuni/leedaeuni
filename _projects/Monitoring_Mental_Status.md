## Research Background
Suicide is a severe health concern worldwide. The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) reported that the suicide rate of South Korea and the USA was 23.0 and 14.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2017, which ranked 1st and 8th, respectively.
The awareness of the severity of suicide has led researchers to develop suicidality detection models using a deluge of user activity data on social media, which can help capture latent warning signs of suicide in an early stage.

## Research Goal
We aims to help to establish a prevention system for early detection and immediate intervention of individuals with high-risk suicidality for clinical support using social media data. This will enable us to reduce mental health-related social costs and promote public health.
