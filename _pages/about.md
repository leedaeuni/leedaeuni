Hello!ðŸ˜Š I am Daeun Lee, and I go by Ellen. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Artificial Intelligence from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in June 2024.
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](https://sites.google.com/view/datasciencelab) with Prof. Jinyoung Han and an Adjunct Professor at SKKU.

My research interests mainly revolve around NLP, Multi-Modal Learning, and Affective Computing. I am excited about developing accessible AI healthcare systems to address tangible real-world challenges. 
I am enthusiastic for collaborating with experts across diverse domains. 
Feel free to reach out with collaboration proposals or for discussions anytime.
