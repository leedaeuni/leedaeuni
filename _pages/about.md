Hello!😊 I am a PhD student in the Dept. of Applied AI at the Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) and a member of [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](https://sites.google.com/view/datasciencelab), advised by Prof. Jinyoung Han. Currently, I am a visiting scholar in the CS & Engineering at the University of South Florida (USF), advised by Prof. Seungbae Kim.

My research interests mainly revolve around NLP, Multi-Modal Learning, and Affective Computing. I am excited about developing accessible AI healthcare systems to address tangible real-world challenges. 

I am enthusiastic for collaborating with experts across diverse domains. 
Feel free to reach out with collaboration proposals or for discussions anytime.
