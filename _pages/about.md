Hello!ðŸ˜Š I am Daeun Lee, and I go by Ellen. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Artificial Intelligence from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in August 2024.
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Yale School of Medicine (Child Study Center), working with Dr. Christine Cha.  I will be conducting interdisciplinary research on youth suicide, integrating artificial intelligence and psychology.

My research interests mainly revolve around NLP, Multi-Modal Learning, and Affective Computing. I am excited about developing accessible AI healthcare systems to address tangible real-world challenges. 
I am enthusiastic for collaborating with experts across diverse domains. 
Feel free to reach out with collaboration proposals or for discussions anytime.
